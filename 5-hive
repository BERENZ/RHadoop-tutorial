Introduction to Hive
====
  
- Hadoop data warehouse
- SQL-like interface
- Language: HQL (Hive Query Language)
- HQL translated into MapReduce jobs
- R interface: RHive, RevoScaleR
- Hue web interface




Computing the number of taxi rides by hour
====
  
Using Hive, we can replicate the rmr2 example counting the number of taxi runs by hour. The steps are

1. Importing the data
2. Querying the data




Defining an external table
====

Starting from our data, we can create a Hive table. Since the data is already in a CSV format, the easiest option is creating an external table.

We need to specify

- The data location
- The data format
- The field formats




Query to create an extenal table
====

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE taxi_sample(medallion STRING, hack_license STRING, vendor_id STRING, rate_code INT, store_and_fwd_flag STRING, pickup_datetime STRING, dropoff_datetime STRING, passenger_count INT, trip_time_in_secs INT, trip_distance FLOAT, pickup_longitude FLOAT, pickup_latitude FLOAT, dropoff_longitude FLOAT, dropoff_latitude FLOAT) ROW FORMAT
DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/user/andrie.devries/taxi/sample';
```



Query to create an external table - defining the field format
====

The first part of the query defines a table called *taxi_sample* and the format of its fields.

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE taxi_sample(medallion STRING, hack_license STRING, vendor_id STRING, rate_code INT, store_and_fwd_flag STRING, pickup_datetime STRING, dropoff_datetime STRING, passenger_count INT, trip_time_in_secs INT, trip_distance FLOAT, pickup_longitude FLOAT, pickup_latitude FLOAT, dropoff_longitude FLOAT, dropoff_latitude FLOAT) ROW FORMAT
```



Query to create an external table: defining the data format
====

This part of the query defines the data format.

```
DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
```


Query to create an external table: defining the data location
====

This part of the query defines the HDFS path to the data folder.

```
LOCATION '/user/andrie.devries/taxi/sample';
```





Simple query: count the number of records
====

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM taxi_sample;
```

173187



Defining the hour field
====

```
SELECT pickup_datetime, substring(pickup_datetime, 12, 2) AS hour
FROM taxi_sample LIMIT 100;
```


Field | Description
---------- | -----------
2013-10-01 00:29:36 | 00
2013-10-01 00:31:00 | 00
2013-10-01 00:38:36 | 00
2013-10-01 00:46:00 | 00
2013-10-01 00:50:08 | 00
2013-10-01 01:00:00 | 01
2013-10-01 01:07:00 | 01




Count by hour
====

```
SELECT substring(pickup_datetime, 12, 2) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM taxi_sample
GROUP BY substring(pickup_datetime, 12, 2);
```

hour | count
---- | -----
00 | 6921
01 | 5101
02 | 3769
03 | 2784
04 | 2025
05 | 1742
06 | 3569




Conclusions
====

- Hive allows to define group-by queries writing SQL-like code
- The MapReduce code is not displayed
- For more complex queries, we will still need to use other tools like rmr2
